    * To alleviate this problem, the static accessor must be defined explicitly on any subclass
    * on which this functionality is necessary.
    * 
    * This method is left protected rather than being removed to retain this notice, and also to
    * allow subclasses to invoke it in implementing their own 'getDefault()' even though 'instance'
    * is 'protected' and directly available to subclasses.
    * 
    * In a subclass implementation, the declared return type may either be this type,
    * 'ActivatorBase', or that specific activator sub-type, which allows access to further methods
    * defined in the sub-type.
